# Static Comments Specification (Draft)

**Status:** Early draft — subject to change

HDOCs and Embedded HDOCs may include a **comments section** displayed in a side panel. Comments are provided as a **JSON array**. The schema is based on the [WordPress Comments API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/comments/), but it is **not limited to WordPress sites** and can be used on any website.

### Key Differences from WordPress

* **Comment ID (`id`)**: Unlike WordPress, the `id` in the Default Web context **can be either an integer or a string**, providing more flexibility for different backends.

### Future Extensions

* Additional fields may be added to support **visible connections** between a comment and specific text segments in the host document.

### Example (JSON structure)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "c1",
    "author_name": "Alice",
    "author_email": "alice@example.com",
    "date": "2025-12-01T14:30:00Z",
    "content": "This is a comment."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "author_name": "Bob",
    "author_email": "bob@example.com",
    "date": "2025-12-01T15:10:00Z",
    "content": "Another comment."
  }
]
```

* `id`: Unique identifier for the comment (integer or string).
* `author_name`: Name of the comment author.
* `author_email`: Email of the comment author.
* `date`: ISO 8601 timestamp of the comment.
* `content`: Comment text.
